For assignment one i began by creating a server within my local machine.
I then began to create the HTML files which led to my three paths describing my fav artist, show and movie
I then used the "touch" command to create a javascript file followed by the "vim" command to edit it'
I then used quicktimeplayer to screen record myself accessing the html files
I the use screencastomatic to record my screen accessing the server
